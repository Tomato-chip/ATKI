# Generated Embedded C Modules

This directory contains embedded C modules (.h and .c files) automatically generated by the C Agent.

Files here are created by:
```bash
cd python_tools/c_agent
./cgen "your module specification"
```

## Structure

Each module gets its own subdirectory:
```
module_name/
  ├── module_name.h    # Header file
  └── module_name.c    # Source file
```

## Usage

To use a generated module in your project:

```bash
# Copy to your project
cp -r ring_buffer your_project/src/

# Add to your build system
# SRCS += src/ring_buffer/ring_buffer.c
# INCS += -Isrc/ring_buffer

# Include in your code
#include "ring_buffer.h"
```

## Note

These files are typically not checked into version control. Review and move them to appropriate project directories if you want to keep them permanently.
