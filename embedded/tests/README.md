# Generated Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests automatically generated by the C Agent.

Files here are created by:
```bash
cd python_tools/c_agent
./cgen "your module specification"
```

## Structure

```
test_module_name.c           # Test source file
out/module_name/             # Compiled test binaries
  └── test_module_name       # Test executable
```

## Running Tests

Tests are automatically run by the agent, but you can run them manually:

```bash
# Run a specific test
./out/ring_buffer/test_ring_buffer

# Compile and run manually
gcc -I../generated ../generated/ring_buffer/ring_buffer.c test_ring_buffer.c -o test_ring_buffer
./test_ring_buffer
```

## Test Framework

Tests use a simple, dependency-free framework:

```c
#define TEST_ASSERT(condition, message) do {
    test_count++;
    if (condition) {
        test_passed++;
        printf("  [PASS] %s\n", message);
    } else {
        printf("  [FAIL] %s\n", message);
    }
} while(0)
```

Returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure.

## Note

These files are typically not checked into version control. Review and adapt them if needed for your project's test suite.
