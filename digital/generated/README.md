# Generated SystemVerilog Modules

This directory contains SystemVerilog modules automatically generated by the SV Agent.

Files here are created by:
```bash
cd python_tools/sv_agent
./svgen "your module specification"
```

These files are typically not checked into version control. Review and move them to appropriate directories if you want to keep them in your project permanently.
